All the Teensy (Panel) code can be found under the NYB V3 2024_2025 folder.

NYE_Ball_Teensy_4.1_Server_Code.ino is the code to run on the Teensy 4.1 Ethernet Server.  This server is the Ethernet server that sends over Power-Wire.

NYB_V3_ESP_Server_2024_2025.ino code does not go on Teensy (panels).  This is the server code that runs on the ESP32 and hosts the wireless server.  THis does not have all the features of the Teensy Server.
